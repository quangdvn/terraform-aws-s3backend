- DynamoDB table — For state locking.
- S3 bucket and Key Management Service (KMS) key — For state storage and encryption at rest.
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) least-privileged role — So other AWS accounts can assume a role 
to this account and perform deployments against the S3 backend.
- Miscellaneous housekeeping resources
